# FeedForwardNN_Classification

# Goal of the model:
Prepare the neural network for defining the data it will receive and initializing its internal parameters and classify the various species of Iris Dataset using color mapping.

# What the model does
This code implements a basic neural network architecture with one hidden layer and uses the Adam optimizer for training. 
The model includes the following functionalities:
1.Loading and Preprocessing the Iris Dataset
2.Defining the Neural Network Class
3.Forward Propagation
4.Training the Model
5.Visualization
